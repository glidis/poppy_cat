- 有效市场假说EMH更多体现在市场是很难被打败的  
- 行为金融是一个不错的备择项，但一个中肯的观点：

> It is ironic that while the EMH is seen as one scapegoat for the 2008 crisis, behavioral finance has survived unscathed, with its reputation even enhanced. On this topic critics apparently focus on policymakers’ and regulators’ apparent faith in the EMH, while ignoring the mistakes made by banks and investors. If the financial industry carried an academic banner in recent decades, it was certainly not for the EMH but for behavioral finance, given the promise that the latter holds for profit-making opportunities.
